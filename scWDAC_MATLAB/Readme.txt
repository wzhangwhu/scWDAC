# Source code for "Clustering Single-Cell Multi-Omics Data via Weighted Distance Penalty and Adaptive Consistent Graph Regularization".

To run the scWDAC method, execute the script "scWDAC_main.m" in MATLAB.

# The external functions used by scWDAC are located in the "functions" folder.

# Example datasets are provided in the "datasets" folder. Each dataset consists of multi-omic data (X), where the dimension of each omic X{v} is n×m (samples×features, eg. number of cells× number of genes), along with the true labels (true_label).
